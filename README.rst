About
-----

**Simple and interactive network visualization in Python.** Network
visualization is an indispensable tool for exploring and communicating
patterns in complex systems. Netwulf offers an ultra-simple API for
**reproducible interactive visualization** of networks directly from a
Python prompt or Jupyter notebook. As a research tool, its purpose is to
allow hassle-free quick interactive layouting/styling for communication
purposes.

The package is build around the philosophy that network manipulation and
preprocessing should be done programmatically, but that the efficient
generation of a visually appealing network is best done interactively,
without code.

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

   pip install netwulf

``netwulf`` was developed and tested for

-  Python 3.5
-  Python 3.6
-  Python 3.7

So far, the package's functionality was tested on Mac OS X, several
Linux distributions and Windows NT. Windows support cannot be guaranteed
as we do not have constant access to machines with this OS.

Dependencies
------------

``netwulf`` directly depends on the following packages which will be
installed by ``pip`` during the installation process

-  ``networkx>=2.0``
-  ``numpy>=0.14``
-  ``matplotlib>=3.0``
-  ``simplejson>=3.0``

Example
-------

Create a network and look at it

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   from netwulf import visualize

   G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(100,m=1)
   visualize(G)

Dev notes
---------

Clone and install this repository as

.. code:: bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:benmaier/netwulf.git
   make

Note that ``make`` per default lets ``pip`` install a development
version of the repository.

The JS base code in ``/netwulf/js/`` is a fork of `Ulf Aslak's
interactive web
app <https://github.com/ulfaslak/network_styling_with_d3>`__. If this
repository is updated, change to ``/netwulf/js/``, then do

.. code:: bash

   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master
   git commit -m "merged"
   git push

If you want to upload to PyPI, first convert the new ``README.md`` to
``README.rst``

.. code:: bash

   make readme

It will give you warnings about bad ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those errors in
``README.rst``. Then wrap the whole thing

.. code:: bash

   make pypi

It will probably give you more warnings about ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those
until the warnings disappear. Then do

.. code:: bash

   make upload
